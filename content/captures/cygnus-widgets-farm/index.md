This is the Sadr region of Cygnus. Fifty-two minutes of data, which is a shame since we originally took 105 light frames, 
but most of them were lost to cloud. 

I love the nebulosity in this one. This was the first image I used star recombination with, which worked really well, 
apart from all the noise around Sadr. I think that's a problem with the capture, though, 
since after star removal you can still see the noise in the background image. It might be possible to manually remove 
that noise with a clone tool, or some masking in GIMP, but I haven't tried it.

In the central part of the lower third of the image you can also see an artifact from the camera lens. Flats would solve
this, but I only stacked against darks, so it will remain!
