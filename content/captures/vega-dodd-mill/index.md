This is a shot of Vega, taken from Bortle 4 skies at Dodd Mill Farm. It's a special one for me 
because it was taken the night I proposed to Lou (which I cleverly got on camera by suggesting that we
need to test the astrophotgraphy equipment!).

The intended target the night we took this was the Andromeda galaxy, but this was only our second time 
setting up the astrophotgraphy equipment. By the time we'd aligned the Sky Adventurer and 
Lou had found the target, cloud had covered it. It looked like the area around Lyra might be clearest for longest, 
so I just pointed the camera up and went for it. 

I actually really like the result here, especially for just 26 frames
at 30-second exposure. I'm a particluar fan of how bright the area around Vega is. I think the center of
Vega is slightly blown out, so I might try and reprocess this in Syril to desaturate it.

There is a weird artifact with a smudge on the stars, which I always seem to have
with this lens. I _think_ they're in focus, but I'll be playing around to see if I can get rid of it.
