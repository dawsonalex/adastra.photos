This is a capture of the Andromeda galaxy, taken during a holiday at the glamping pod at Widgets Farm, in Frome. 
(I highly recommend going if you have a dog, it's dog friendly and very relaxing!). We were lucky 
to get about 90 minutes of capture before cloud came in. It was also a good test of how well I could align the 
Star Adventurer, since this was the longest exposure we'd done by far, at 120 seconds.

These frames were taken with 120 seconds exposure and 200 ISO. I've heard that to get a really
good image you need around 4 hours of data, so I'd like to come back to this, and maybe include
some shorter 30 second exposures to process the core separately.

If you look closely you can spot Messier 110, too!
